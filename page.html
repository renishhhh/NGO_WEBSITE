                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are a non-profit organization that is aimed at nurturing reading habits in children between the age group of 5â€“15-year-olds. Our dream is to create equal opportunities for the children that they can utilize to become better citizens in the future. We further want to support their dreams and talents with the help of our initiatives that have shown some significant impact over the past years. Our team is committed to ensure the best for the children and work day and night to make a change in the system.</p>
                
                <p>Akshar Bharati is an initiative to nurture the reading habits in children between the age group 5-15 years from underprivileged and remote areas by facilitating access to good non-academic literature. We set up libraries for such children in their localities so that the books are available when they need them the most. We strongly believe that quality reading develops the wisdom to make appropriate choices as one grows which ultimately enhances the quality of life by becoming better citizens. This is our way of contributing to India's Vision 2020 of being a developed and self-sufficient nation.</p>
